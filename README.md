# Level 2 Task 8 -Recursion

## Task 1

Follow these steps:

● In a file called palindrome.java, create:

o a recursive function that determines whether a given array is a palindrome.

o Compile, save and run your file.

## Task 2

Follow these steps:

● In a file called LCMRecursion.java, create:

o a recursive function to calculate the lowest common multiple (LCM) for two numbers x and y using recursion.

o LCM is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both the numbers.

o Compile, save and run your file.

## Optional Bonus Task

Follow these steps:

● Create a file called searchReplace.java. In here, create a program that implements a search and replace function recursively. 

Your program should allow a user to enter a string, a substring they wish to find and another string with which they wish to replace the found substring.

The output of your program should be similar to the output given below:

Please enter a string: Hello world

Please enter the substring you wish to find: llo

Please enter a string to replace the given substring: @@
